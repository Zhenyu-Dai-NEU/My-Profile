  <p>
    When I talk about food, I’m not just talking about flavors—I’m also talking about the culture behind it.
    I enjoy trying more food botn in restaurants and at home. From dumplings during holidays to experimenting with mushroom soup in a small kitchen abroad,
    food helps me stay connected with my roots while exploring new worlds.
  </p>

  
  <p>
    However, when I study abroad, I deeply understance the gap between the food of eastern and western. I really want to recommend some food to other people.
    But different flavor and different preference make me hard to express and tell people which's the best one. I do hope I can find some friends who can hangout and hit the restaurants together.
